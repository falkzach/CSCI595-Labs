            <h2>What is food insecurity?</h2>
            <p>The inability to access food in a consistent manner, resulting in reduced quality or variety of diet. While food banks and federal nutrition programs have made severe hunger and malnutrition rare in this country, millions of low-income Americans are still faced with food insecurity.</p>
            <h2>What is hunger?</h2>
            <p>Hunger occurs when households must reduce food intake or skip meals because the household lacks money and other resources for food. Hunger is also defined as the uneasy or painful sensation caused by lack of food.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Donations to the Montana Food Bank Network enable us to help more than 200 agencies across Montana provide food to those in need</li>
                <li> In 2013, over 138,000 Montanans received food through the agencies of the Montana Food Bank Network.</li>
                <li> In addition to providing emergency food, the Montana Food Bank Network works to increase participation in the public food programs and supports policies to bring sustainable long-term solutions to hunger.</li>
